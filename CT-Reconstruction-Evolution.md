## 0. Abstract

The first CT scanners in the early 1970s already used iterative reconstruction algorithms; however, lack of computational power prevented their clinical use. In fact, it took until 2009 for the first iterative reconstruction algorithms to come commercially available and replace conventional filtered back projection. Since then, this technique has caused a true hype in the field of radiology. Within a few years, all major CT vendors introduced iterative reconstruction algorithms for clinical routine, which evolved rapidly into increasingly advanced reconstruction algorithms. The complexity of algorithms ranges from hybrid-, model- based to fully iterative algorithms. As a result, the number of scientific publications on this topic has skyrocketed over the last decade. But what exactly has this technology brought us so far? And what can we expect from future hardware as well as software developments, such as photon-counting CT and artificial intelligence? This paper will try answer those questions by taking a concise look at the overall evolution of CT image reconstruction and its clinical implementations. Subsequently, we will give a prospect towards future developments in this domain.

早期1970s的第一台CT，就已经使用的迭代重建算法(IR)；但是，计算能力的缺乏，限制了其临床使用。实际上，直到2009年，IR才第一次进入商用，替换了传统的滤波反投影。自从那时，这种技术在放射领域带来了一种过度宣传。在几年之内，所有主要的CT供应商都为临床引入了IR算法，然后快速演化到越来越高级的重建算法。算法复杂度从混合迭代，基于模型的迭代到完全迭代算法。结果是，这个领域的科学发表量在过去十年中迅速飙升。但这种技术到现在带给了我们什么？从未来的硬件和软件开发中，我们可以期待什么，比如光子计数CT和人工智能？本文会简单回顾一下CT重建的演化及其临床实现，来回答这个问题。后续，我们会展望一下这个领域的未来发展。

Since its introduction in 1972 [1, 2], computed tomography (CT) has evolved into a highly successful and indispensable diagnostic tool. The success story of CT is reflected by the number of annual CT exams, which increased yearly with 6.5% over the last decade resulting in a total of 80 million CT scans in 2015 in the USA [3]. After this first tomographic imaging modality was introduced, its technological developments advanced rapidly. The first clinical CT scan took about 5 min, and image reconstruction took approximately the same time [2]. Despite long reconstruction times, image resolution was poor with only 80 × 80 pixels [2]. Nowadays, rotation speeds are accelerated to approximately a quarter of a second per rotation, and detector coverage, along the patient axis, increased up to 16 cm in high-end systems, allowing for imaging the whole heart in a single heartbeat [4]. Resolution of cross-sectional images increased to 512 × 512 pixels for most clinical applications and to 1024 × 1024 pixels or more for state-of-the-art CT scanners [5, 6].

自从1972年的发明，CT经过不断演化，已经成为了一种高度成功的必不可少的诊断工具。CT的成功故事，可以由每年CT检查的数量反应出来，在美国的过去十年，每年增长6.5%，得到总共有8000万CT scans。在提出了这第一种断层成像模态之后，其技术开发推进迅速。第一个临床的CT扫描耗时大约5分钟，图像重建耗时几乎一样。尽管重建耗时很长，图像分辨率还是很低，只有80×80的像素。现在在高端系统中，旋转速度加快到了每一圈约1/4秒，沿着患者轴的探测器覆盖增加到了16cm，可以在一次心跳周期中对整个心脏进行成像。横断面图像的分辨率，对于多数临床应用，增加到了512×512像素，在目前最好的CT中，增加到了1024×1024像素。

The increasing number of CT exams, however, has a major drawback. Radiation exposure to society has significantly increased since the introduction of CT imaging, which is especially problematic for younger patients. The combination of growing community awareness about exposure-associated health risks [7] and CT communities’ efforts to tackle them has already led to significant reduction in CT dose. The most important way to reduce CT-radiation exposure is clearly to use this technique only when benefits outweigh the risks as well as costs [8]. However, dose-reduction techniques are necessary in case a CT scan is clinically indicated. Multiple dose-reduction methods were introduced, including tube current modulation [9], organ-specific care [10], beam-shaping filters [11], and most importantly optimization of CT parameters. Essential parameters of every CT protocol include tube current (mA), tube voltage (kV), pitch, voxel size, slice thickness, reconstruction filters, and the number of rotations. It is essential to realize that a different combination of parameters enables significantly different image qualities while delivering the same radiation dose to the patient. For example, the combination of large pixels with a smooth filter can provide diagnostic quality for specific indications, while the same acquisition reconstructed with smaller pixels and a sharper filter would provide non-diagnostic quality through a higher level of noise and artifacts. In the clinical routine, radiation exposure is frequently controlled by adjusting the tube current. When decreasing the tube current, one can observe a proportional increase in image noise. Thus, another dose-reduction technique concerns the proper treatment of image noise and artifacts within the reconstruction of three-dimensional data from raw projection data. Originally, CT images were reconstructed with an iterative method called algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) [12]. Due to lack of computational power, this technique was quickly replaced by simple analytic methods such as filtered back projection (FBP). FBP was the method of choice for decades, until the first iterative reconstruction (IR) technique was clinically introduced in 2009. This caused a true hype in the CT-imaging domain. Within a few years, all major CT vendors introduced IR algorithms for clinical use, which evolved rapidly into increasingly advanced reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we will take a concise look at the overall evolution of CT image reconstruction and its clinical implementations. Subsequently, we will give a prospect towards future developments in sparse-sampling CT [13], photon-counting CT [14], phase-contrast/dark-field CT [15, 16], and artificial intelligence [17].

但越来越多的CT检查，都有一个主要缺点。自从引入CT成像以来，放射线照射增加非常显著，这对年轻病人尤其是个问题。公众对照射相关的健康风险越来越关注，CT团体也不断努力解决这个问题，这已经显著降低了CT剂量。降低CT辐射照射的最重要的方式，当然是好处超过了风险以及代价的时候，这是很明显的。但是，降低剂量技术只有在CT具备临床指征的时候才是必要的。提出了多种剂量降低的方法，包括球管电流调制[9]，特定器官的定制[10]，束流形成的滤波器[11]，以及CT参数的优化。每个CT的基本参数有，球管电流(mA)，球管电压(kV)，pitch，体素大小，层厚，重建滤波器，和旋转数量。必须要意识到，参数的不同组合，会得到显著不同的图像质量，而病人的辐射剂量是一样的。比如，大像素、平滑滤波器可以对特定病症得到诊断质量的图像，而用更小的像素和更尖锐的滤波器重建得到的图像，得到的图像质量还达不到诊断级的图像，因为有很多的噪声和伪影。在临床中，放射照射通常通过调整管电流来控制。当降低管电流时，可以观察到同比例的图像噪声的增加。因此，另一种降低剂量的技术关注的是，在从原始投影数据到三维数据的重建中，图像噪声和伪影的处理。最开始，CT图像是通过一种迭代方法来重建的，称为代数重建技术(ART)[12]。由于缺少计算能力，这种技术迅速被简单的解析法替换了，如滤波反投影(FBP)。FBP是几十年中的选用的方法，直到在2009年，第一次在临床中引入了迭代重建(IR)技术。这在CT成像领域导致了一阵狂热。几年中，所有主要的CT厂商都将IR算法带入了临床，这迅速演化，得到了越来越先进的重建算法。本文中，我们会简单回顾一下CT重建的总体演化，及其临床实现。下面，我们会给出CT的未来发展方向，如稀疏采样CT，光子计数CT，相位对比CT，暗场CT，以及人工智能。

## 1. From concept to clinical necessity

In December 1970, Gordon et al presented initial work on ART [18], which is a method belonging to a class of IR algorithms that was initially applied to reconstruct cross-sectional images. However, due to a lack of computation power, ART was not clinically applicable, and a simpler algorithm, namely FBP was standard for decades. With FBP, CT slices are reconstructed from projection data (sinograms) by applying a high-pass filter followed by a backward projection step (Fig. 1A). With the fast progress in CT technology, FBP-based algorithms got improved and extended to keep up with hardware progress, such as Feldkamp et al’s 1984 solution for reconstruction of data from large area detectors [19]. In most circumstances, FBP works well and results in images with high diagnostic quality. However, due to the increasing concerns of exposing (younger) patients with ionizing radiation, more CT scans were being acquired at a lower radiation dose. Unfortunately, this resulted in significantly reduced image quality, because there is a direct proportional relation between image noise and radiation exposure. Also, with the growing prevalence rates of obesity [20], image quality of CT scans reconstructed with FBP deteriorated. With a larger body size, the x-ray photon attenuation increases which leads to less photons reaching the CT detector, finally resulting in significantly reduced image quality. The benefit of FBP is the short reconstruction time, but the major disadvantage is that it inputs raw data into a "black box" where only very limited model and prior information can be applied, for example to properly model image noise when a small number of photons reach the CT detector.

在1970年12月，Gordon等提出了ART的初始工作[18]，这是IR算法的一种，最初用于重建横断面的图像。但是，由于缺少计算能力，ART无法在临床应用，而一种更简单的算法，即FBP成为了几十年中的标准。使用FBP，CT slices从投影数据(sinograms)中进行重建，首先进行一个高通滤波，然后进行反向投影，见图1A。随着CT技术的快速进步，基于FBP的算法得到了改进和拓展，以适应硬件的发展，如Feldkamp等1984年从大面积检测器的数据中进行重建。在多数情况中，FBP工作的还不错，得到的图像都有很高的诊断质量。但是，由于越来越担心对年轻患者辐射过大，更多的CT都是用更低的辐射剂量形成的。不幸的是，这会得到明显降低的图像质量，因为在图像噪声和放射照射之间有直接的比例关系。同时，由于肥胖率的增加，用FBP重建的CT图像质量变差了。身体体型更大，x射线光子的衰减增加了，这样达到CT检测器的光子更少了，最终导致图像质量明显降低。FBP的优势是重建时间短，但主要的劣势是，其将原始数据输入到了一个黑箱，其中只能应用很有限的模型和先验知识，比如在只有很少光子达到CT检测器时，合理的对图像噪声进行建模。

While clinical scanners operated with FBP, the CT research community spent a significant effort into the development of advanced IR algorithms, with the goal to enable low-dose CT with high diagnostic quality. These developments fall loosely into three basic approaches: (i) sinogram-based [21–23], (ii) image domain-based [24–26], and (iii) fully iterative algorithms [18, 27–30]. A parallel progress was an increasing availability of cost-efficient computational tools, such as programmable graphics processing units (GPUs) for accelerated CT reconstruction [31, 32]. This combination of developments has triggered the medical device industry to develop advanced reconstruction algorithms. In 2009, the first IR algorithm called IRIS (iterative reconstruction in image space, Siemens Healthineers) received FDA clearance [33]. This was a simple method that—similar to FBP—only applied a single backward projection step to create a cross-sectional image from raw data. Image noise was iteratively reduced in image space [34].

在临床的CT使用FBP时，CT研究团体在开发先进IR算法上进行了很多的努力，其目标是用低剂量达到高诊断质量的CT重建。这些发展大致可以分为三类：(i)基于sinogram的[21-23]，(ii)基于图像域的[24-26]，(iii)完全迭代的算法[18,27-30]。还有一个并行的过程，是高效计算工具的可用性也越来越多，如GPU，可用于加速CT重建。这种开发组合使得医学设备厂商开始开发先进的重建算法。在2009年，第一个IR算法，称为IRIS（图像空间的迭代重建，西门子Healthineers）得到了FDA的许可[33]。这是一个简单的方法，与FBP类似，只使用了一个反向投影过程，从原始数据中创建一个横断面图像。图像噪声在图像空间中进行迭代降低。

Within 2 years, four more advanced IR algorithms received FDA clearance: ASIR (adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, GE Healthcare), SAFIRE (sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction, Siemens Healthineers), iDose4 (Philips Healthcare), and Veo (GE Healthcare) [35–38]. The first three methods are so-called hybrid IR algorithms. Similar to FBP and IRIS, a single backward projection step is used. However, hybrid IR methods are more advanced since they iteratively filter the raw data to reduce artifacts, and after the backward projection, the image data are iteratively filtered to reduce image noise (Fig. 1B). Veo was the first clinical fully iterative IR algorithm, which was one of the most advanced algorithms so far [39]. In fully IR, raw data are backward projected into the cross-sectional image space. Subsequently, image space data are forward projected to calculate artificial raw data. The forward projection step is a core module of IR algorithms, since it enables the physically correct modulation of the data acquisition process (including system geometry and noise models). The artificial raw data are compared to the true raw data to thereupon update the cross-sectional image. In parallel, image noise is removed via a regularization step (Fig. 1, right column). The process of backward and forward projection is repeated until the difference between true and artificial raw data is minimized.

在两年中，四种更先进的IR算法得到了FDA的许可：ASIR（自适应统计迭代重建，GE Healthcare），SAFIRE（sinogram确认的迭代重建，西门子Healthineers），iDose4（飞利浦Healthcare）和Veo (GE Healthcare)。前三种方法是所谓的混合重建算法。与FBP和IRIS类似，使用了一个反向投影过程。但是，混合IR方法是更先进的，因为会对原始数据进行迭代滤波，以降低伪影，而在反向投影之后，图像数据也会进行迭代滤波，以降低图像噪声。Veo是第一种临床可用的全迭代IR算法，这也是迄今为止最先进的算法之一。在完全IR算法中，原始数据反向投影到横断面图像中。然后，图像空间的数据进行正向投影，以计算仿真的原始数据。正向投影步骤是IR算法的一个核心模块，因为可以修正物理上的数据获取过程（包括系统几何和噪声模型）。仿真的原始数据与真实的原始数据进行对比，然后更新横断面图像。与此同时，图像噪声通过一个正则化步骤进行去除（图1右）。反向和正向投影的过程反复进行，直到真实原始数据和仿真原始数据的差异最小化。

Fig. 1 Filtered back projection (FBP), hybrid iterative reconstruction (IR), and model-based IR. With FBP, images are reconstructed from projection data (sinograms) by applying a high-pass filter followed by a backward projection step (left column). In hybrid IR, the projection data is iteratively filtered to reduce artifacts, and after the backward projection step, the image data are iteratively filtered to reduce image noise (middle column). In model-based IR, the projection data are backward projected into the cross-sectional image space. Subsequently, image space data are forward projected to calculate artificial projection data. The artificial projection data are compared to the true projection data to thereupon update the cross-sectional image. In parallel, image noise is removed via a regularization step.

One can imagine that fully IR is computationally more demanding than hybrid IR resulting in longer reconstruction times of fully IR. Due to these long reconstruction times, the vendor decided to develop a different advanced algorithm called ASIR-V (GE Healthcare), which received FDA clearance in 2014. In the meantime, other hybrid and model-based IR algorithms were introduced by other vendors, including AIDR3D (adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D, Canon Healthcare), ADMIRE (advanced modeled iterative reconstruction, Siemens Healthineers), and IMR (iterative model reconstruction, Philips Healthcare) (Table 1). Most recently, in 2016, the model-based IR algorithm FIRST (forward projected model-based iterative reconstruction solution, Canon Healthcare) received FDA-clearance. The introduction of IR for clinical CT imaging resulted in a substantial number of studies evaluating the possibilities of these methods (Fig. 2). Overall, these studies showed improved image quality and diagnostic value with IR compared to FBP. Radiation dose can be reduced with IR by 23 to 76% without compromising on image quality [40]. Some studies compared the different approaches of multiple vendors, and in general, these studies found that radiation dose can be reduced further with model-based IR compared to hybrid IR and FBP [39, 41] (Fig. 3). 

可以想象，完全IR算法计算量非常大，比混合IR要大的多，这样重建时间就更长。因为重建时间很长，供应商决定开发一种不同的先进算法，称为ASIR-V (GE Healthcare)，在2014年获得FDA许可。同时，其他混合的和基于模型的IR算法由其他厂商提出，包括AIDR3D（自适应迭代3D剂量降低，Canon Healthcare），ADMIRE（先进建模的迭代重建，Siemens Healthineers），和IMR（迭代模型重建，Philips Healthcare），见表1。最近，在2016年，基于模型的IR算法FIRST（前向投影的基于模型的迭代重建解决方案，Canon Healthcare）获得FDA许可。IR在临床CT成像的引入，带来了很多的研究，评估这些方法的可能性，见图2。总体上，这些研究表明，与FBP相比，IR可以改进图像质量和诊断质量。采用IR可以降低放射剂量的23%到76%，而图像质量不打折扣。一些研究比较了多个厂商的不同方法，总体上来说，这些研究发现，采用基于模型的IR算法，与采用混合IR和FBP相比，放射剂量可以进一步降低。

Fig. 3 One ex vivo human heart, scanned at 4 mGy and 1 mGy (75% dose-reduction) with high-end CT scanners from four vendors. Images are reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), hybrid iterative reconstruction, and model-based iterative reconstruction. Numbers represent noise levels (standard deviations) in air. Images derived from a study published before by Willemink et al [39].

Multiple studies evaluated the effect of IR on image quality of specific body parts. Relatively low hanging fruit is the CT examination of high-contrast body regions such as the lungs. Due to the low attenuation of x-rays passing through the air in the lungs, and due to the high natural contrast between air and the lung tissue, the radiation dose of chest CT examinations was already relatively low to begin with. In a systematic review of 24 studies, Den Harder et al [42] found that the average radiation dose of 2.6 (1.5–21.8) mSv for chest CT scans reconstructed with FBP could be reduced to 1.4 (0.7–7.8) mSv by applying IR. Similarly, the radiation dose in another high-contrast body region, CT angiography of the heart, could be reduced substantially. With FBP, the average radiation dose of ten coronary CT angiography studies was 4.2 (3.5–5.0) mSv, which could be reduced to 2.2 (1.3–3.1) mSv by using IR, with preserved objective and subjective image quality [43]. Reducing the CT radiation dose of body regions with low contrast such as the abdomen is, however, more problematic [44]. Detectability of low-contrast lesions cannot always be improved with IR at lower radiation doses [45]. However, most studies found that IR does allow for radiation dose reduction of abdominal CT exams without compromising on image quality [46, 47].

多个研究评估了在特定身体部位上IR算法对图像质量的影像。较容易的成果是，高对比度的身体区域如肺的CT检查。由于x射线穿过肺部的空气时衰减很低，而且由于空气和肺部组织的对比度很高，胸部CT检查的放射剂量本来就已经比较低了。在24个系统的研究中，Den Harder等[42]发现，用FBP算法重建的胸部CT的平均辐射剂量为2.6(1.5-21.8)mSv，采用IR算法，可以降低到1.4(0.7-7.8)mSv。类似的，另一个高对比度身体区域的放射剂量，心脏的CT血管造影术，也可以得到极大的降低。采用FBP，10个冠状CT血管造影术的平均辐射剂量为4.2(3.5–5.0)mSv，采用IR算法，可以降低到2.2(1.3–3.1)mSv，图像的主观质量和客观质量都没有降低。在低对比度的身体区域，降低CT放射剂量，如腹部，则有更多的问题。低对比度的损伤的可检测性，采用IR算法在更低的辐射剂量下，不能一直得到改进。但是，多数研究发现，IR算法可以在降低剂量的同时，进行腹部CT检查，对图像质量没有折扣效果。

## 2. Current and future developments

While the number of clinical IR-related publications and the speed of introducing novel clinical algorithms have slowed down, the challenge of reducing radiation exposure remains a topic of high interest. So far, most dose-reduction strategies remained in the domain of decreasing tube current or tube voltage while IR algorithms insure an acceptable diagnostic image quality. A fundamentally different way to reduce radiation exposure is to acquire less projection images, e.g., acquire only every second, fourth, or so projection. This compressed-sensing [48, 49] inspired strategy is widely known as sparse-sampling CT. This approach allows acquiring a reduced number of projections, while the radiation exposure remains high for each individual projection image. The clear benefit of sparse-sampling acquisitions is an improved quality for each individual projection (e.g., increased signal-to-noise ratio) while circumventing the influence of electronic readout noise. Those benefits allow for an additional dose reduction by a factor of two or more when comparing to dose levels achieved with current technology. However, to reconstruct a cross-sectional image from those highly under-sampled data, a fully IR algorithm is imperative. Over the last decade, several investigators have presented IR solutions [50–55], which have the potential to be clinically introduced in the future. Translation into the clinical routine is highly depending on when sparse-sampling capable hardware, e.g., novel x-ray tubes, will become available. However, first evaluations of the clinical potential have been published [56]. One example is the possibility to quantitatively determine bone mineral density (BMD) from the combination of ultra-low-dose sparse-sampling acquisitions and a fully IR algorithm [57].

与IR算法相关的发表文章数量在下降，提出新的临床算法速度也在下降，但降低辐射照射的挑战仍然是大家都很感兴趣的话题。迄今为止，多数降低剂量的策略，还停留在降低管电流或管电压，同时IR算法保证可以接受的诊断图像质量。一种根本上不同的降低剂量的方法是，获得更少的投影图像，如只获得1/2，1/4等的投影图像。这种受到compressed-sensing启发的策略，就是大家广为熟知的稀疏采样CT。这种方法只获得很少数量的投影图像，而放射照射对于每个单独的投影图像，仍然很高。稀疏采样的明显好处是，对于每个投影，其质量非常好（如，SNR很高），而避免了电路读出噪声的影像。这些好处使得，与目前技术的剂量相比，剂量可以额外的降低1/2或更多。但是，为从这些降采样的数据中重建横断面图像，必须使用完全IR算法。在过去十年中，数位研究者提出了IR解决方案[50-55]，有在未来应用于临床的潜力。但是，临床潜力的第一种评估已经发表了[56]。一个例子是，使用超低剂量的稀疏采样和完全IR算法的组合，定量的确定骨矿物密度(BMD)[57]。

The integration of advanced prior knowledge into IR algorithms has been a parallel development over the last years. Compared to conventional FBP, IR allows integrating prior knowledge into the reconstruction process. One idea is to utilize previous examination as part of the image formation process. For example, during an oncological follow-up, many patients undergo sequential studies of the same anatomical region. Through the fact that there is shared anatomical information in between the scans, one can utilize this fact in an IR algorithm to significantly improve diagnostic image quality while reducing radiation exposure [58–61]. A different example for prior knowledge is to integrate information concerning orthopedic implants into the reconstruction process. Metal artifact, which can introduce extensive noise and streaks, is caused by implants consisting of materials with high z values. However, if the shape and material composition of the implant is known a priori (e.g., from a computer-aided design (CAD) model or a spectral analysis), it has been illustrated that integrating this information into the image formation eliminates artifacts and improves diagnostic image quality [62, 63].

先验知识与IR算法的集成，在过去几年中也是一个发展方向。与传统FBP算法相比，IR算法可以将先验知识集成到重建过程中。一种思想是，利用之前的检查作为图像形成过程的一部分。比如，在一个肿瘤随访中，很多病人经历了相同解剖部位的连续检查。在scans之间是有共同的解剖信息的，可以在IR算法中利用这个事实，以显著改进诊断图像质量，同时降低放射照射。先验知识的另一个例子是，将整形植入物的信息考虑到重建过程中。金属伪影会带来很大的噪声和条纹，这是由于植入物包含的材料，其z值非常高。但是，如果植入物的形状和物质组成是已经知道的（如，从CAD模型或谱分析），有文章表示，将这些信息整合到图像形成过程中，可以消除伪影，改进诊断图像质量。

Another technology that has found its way into the clinical environment is dual energy CT (DECT). DECT enables material decomposition, which is the quantification of an object composition by exploiting measurements of the material- and energy-dependent x-ray attenuation of various materials using a low- and high-energy spectrum (Fig. 4) [64–66]. This technology has the potential to improve contrast and reduce artifacts as compared to conventional CT. While those advances are becoming clinically available, the issue related to radiation exposure remains, especially for this CT modality. The material decomposition step can significantly intensify image noise when data are acquired with a low radiation exposure. Further, the direct implementation of model-based or fully IR requires several modifications to account for the statistical dependencies between the material-decomposed data. This dependency includes anti-correlated noise, which plays a significant role in the overall image quality in material images. IR-algorithms allow to model anti-correlated noise with a result of significantly improved diagnostic image quality [67–69]. Over the last years, this class of IR specific for DECT has been introduced into the clinical routine. The results can be observed when considering the contrast-to-noise ratio in virtual monoenergetic images (VMI). In theory, a strong increase in noise should be observed towards low VMI (keV) settings and a moderate increase in high VMIs [66, 70]. In DECT scanners with latest IR, one can observe almost no increase in noise for low or high VMI settings [71, 72]. Different DECT acquisition approaches are available including two x-ray tubes with different voltages, one x-ray tube switching between voltages, one x-ray tube with a partly filtered beam, and detector-based spectral separation. Dedicated IR algorithms, accounting for differences in CT design, become necessary for each of these DECT schemes. Further improvements for DECT-specific IR can be expected, for example with the integration of learning algorithms, such as dictionaries [73–75].

另一种进入临床的技术是双能CT(DECT)。DECT可以进行物质分解，这是一种目标组成的量化，使用低能谱和高能谱，对各种物质，度量其与物质相关的和能量相关的X射线衰减。这种技术与传统CT相比，有潜力改进对比度，降低伪影。当这种进步变得临床可用时，与放射照射的问题仍然存在，尤其是对于这种CT模态。物质分解这步，当数据是用低放射照射获得时，会显著强化图像噪声。而且，基于模型的或完全IR算法的直接实现，需要几个修正，以利用物质分解相关的数据的统计相关性。这种相关性包括，反相关的噪声，这在物质图像中起着很重要的作用。IR算法可以对反相关噪声进行建模，其结果可以显著改进诊断图像质量。在过去几年中，这种IR特定的DECT已经引入到临床中。在虚拟的单能图像(VMI)中，考虑对比度对噪声的比，可以观察到明显的改进。在带有最新IR算法的DECT中，可以观察到，在低或高VMI设置中，都没有噪声的增加。不同的DECT获取方法都是可用的，包括两个不同电压的x射线球管，一个x射线球管变换电压，一个x射线球管带有部分滤波的射束，和基于检测器的能谱分离。精细的IR算法，是不同CT设计的区别，是这些DECT方案所必须的。更多对于DECT特定的IR算法会涌现出来，比如带有学习算法的整合，如字典[73-75]。

An upcoming spectral CT technology, which is gaining clinical interest, is photon-counting CT (PCCT). This unique technology is capable of counting individual x-ray photons while rejecting noise, rather than simply integrating the electrical signal in each pixel. Also, these detectors can perform "color" x-ray detection; they can discriminate the energy of individual photons and divide them into several pre-defined but selectable energy bins, thereby providing a spectral analysis of the transmitted x-ray beam [76–79]. First clinical evaluations illustrated promising performance with respect to quantitative imaging, material specific (K-edge) imaging, high-resolution imaging, and a new level of diagnostic image quality in combination with significant reduction in radiation exposure [80–86]. While first results render the potential benefits of this technology, challenges concerning hardware and software remain. IR plays a central role to overcome those challenges. However, IR algorithms that are used in conventional CT are not optimal for PCCT, because of reasons similar to the statistical dependencies in DECT. For example, PCCT data are more complex than conventional CT data since additional multi-energetic information is present, and additional detector elements can be employed to achieve high spatial resolution images, depending on detector configuration and hardware and software settings. These variations in image acquisition as well as differences in the noise model of PCCT data need to be integrated into the model of the forward projector to fully utilize the power of IR algorithms. One of the reconstruction challenges in PCCT is that the step of material decomposition and image reconstruction are performed separately. This separation implies a loss of information, for which the second step cannot compensate. To adapt IR for this higher level of complexity, image reconstruction and material decomposition can be performed jointly [87]. This can be accomplished by a forward model, which directly connects the (expected) spectral projection measurements and the material-selective images [88–92]. First results illustrated the possibility to overcome challenges related to PCCT, but current IR algorithms are still too computationally intensive, and therefore reconstruction times are too long for clinical use. Further development towards IR solutions with clinical feasible reconstruction times is imperative.

一种即将到来的能谱CT技术，越来越获得了临床的兴趣，是光子计数CT(PCCT)。这种技术可以对X射线光子数进行计数，同时防止噪声，而不是在每个像素中对电荷信号进行简单的积分。同时，这些检测器可以进行x射线的颜色检测；可以区分单个光子的能量，将其分到几个预定义但可选的能量bins中，因此可以对传输的x射线射束进行谱分析。第一个临床评价的结果表明，在定量成像、对特定物质的成像、高分辨率成像方面，和一种新的诊断成像质量同时辐射照射显著降低上，性能非常有希望。第一次的结果给出了这种技术的可能好处，但硬件和软件方面的挑战仍然存在。在克服这种挑战中，IR扮演了关键的角色。但是，在传统CT中使用的IR算法，对于PCCT不是最优的，因为在DECT中是有统计依赖性的，在PCCT中也类似的有。比如，PCCT数据比传统CT数据更复杂，因为额外的多能信息是存在的，可以采用额外的检测器元素得到高空间分辨率图像，这依赖于检测器配置和硬件、软件设置。图像获取中的这些变化，以及PCCT数据中的噪声模型的差异，需要整合进模型的前向投影中，以充分利用IR算法的能量。PCCT重建的一个挑战是，物质分解和图像重建的步骤是分开进行的。这种分离意味着信息的损失，这样第二个步骤不能进行补偿。为使IR适应这些高度的复杂性，图像重建和物质分解可以同时进行。这可以通过一个前向模型完成，直接连接了期望的谱投影度量和物质选择图像。第一次的结果描述了克服与PCCT相关联的挑战的可能性，但目前IR算法仍然计算量太大，因此重建时间太长不能进行临床使用。IR要进行临床可用的重建，还需要进一步的发展。

Besides spectral CT, other fundamental CT developments are currently being investigated, namely phase-contrast and dark-field CT. Image contrast in current CT imaging is based on a particle model describing the physical interaction of photoelectric absorption and Compton scattering. Phase-contrast and dark-field CT are based on an electromagnetic wave model, and thus image contrast represents wave-optical interactions such as phase-shift or small-angle scattering. These novel imaging methods make use of these wave optical characteristics of x-rays, by applying for example a grating interferometer to x-ray imaging [93–98]. Compared to conventional CT, additional and complementary information become available. Phase-contrast CT offers significantly higher soft-tissue contrast [99–101], and dark-field CT offers structural information below the spatial resolution of the imaging system [102–104]. When considering a translation, clinical standards, for example with respect to radiation dose and acquisition time, need to be maintained. To ensure those clinical standards, one path is to reconstruct raw data with tailored IR algorithms. Initial investigations have illustrated the high potential of IR algorithms to enhance the image quality in phase-contrast as well as dark-field CT [105–108]. One challenge was the fact that a CT with continuous rotations seems to be not feasible; however, latest developments in fully IR algorithms have enabled the possibility of a continuously rotating gantry [16, 109, 110]. This is a significant step towards clinical translation of phase-contrast and dark-field CT.

除了能谱CT，目前还正在研究其他更基本的CT进展，即相位对比度和暗场CT。在目前的CT成像中，图像对比度是基于一个粒子模型的，描述的是光电吸收和康普顿散射的物理作用。相位对比度和暗场CT是基于一种电磁波模型的，因此图像对比度表示波-光学相互作用，如相位偏移或小角度散射。这些新的成像方法使用了这些x射线的波光学特定，比如对x射线成像应用了一个grating interferometer。与传统CT相比，可用的还有额外的信息和互补的信息。相位对比度CT，可以得到明显高很多的软组织对比度，而暗场CT在成像系统的空间分辨率下，会给出结构信息。当考虑到向临床迁移时，需要维护临床标准，如对放射剂量和获取时间。为确保这些临床标准，一种路径是用定制的IR算法重建原始数据。初始的调查说明，IR算法有很高的潜力来在相位对比度和暗场CT中增强图像质量。一个挑战是，有连续旋转的CT似乎不太可行；但是，在全IR算法中最新的进展，已经可以在连续旋转的机架上进行。这是迈向临床可用的相位对比度CT和暗场CT的重要一步。

Another emerging technique is artificial intelligence (AI). Besides classification of images, detection of objects and playing games [111, 112], AI has gained substantial interest for its potential to improve reconstruction of CT images [17]. AI, and more specifically machine learning, is a group of methods that is able to produce a mapping from raw inputs, such as intensities of individual pixels, to specific outputs, such as classification of a disease [113]. With machine learning, the input is based on hand-engineered features, while unsupervised deep learning is able to learn these features itself directly from data. Multiple research groups are working on applying AI to improve the reconstruction of CT images. One application is image-space-based reconstructions in which convolutional neural networks are trained with low-dose CT images to reconstruct routine-dose CT images [17, 114, 115]. Another approach is to optimize IR algorithms [116]. Generally, IR algorithms are based on manually designed prior functions resulting in low-noise images without loss of structures [117]. Deep learning methods allow for implementing more complex functions, which have the potential to enable lower-dose CT [117–120] and sparse-sampling CT [121]. These AI techniques have the potential to reduce CT radiation doses while speeding up reconstruction times. Also, deep learning can be used to optimize image quality without reducing the radiation dose, e.g., by more advanced DECT monochromatic image reconstruction [122] and metal artifact reduction [123, 124]. These methods are not yet ready for clinical implementation; however, it is expected that AI will play, in the near future, a major role in CT image reconstruction and restoration. We expect that AI will fit in current clinical CT imaging workflow by enhancing current reconstruction methods, for example by significantly accelerating the reconstruction process since application of a trained network can be instantaneously.

另一种技术就是人工智能(AI)。除了图像分类，目标检测和博弈，AI已经可以改进CT图像的重建了。AI，更具体的说就是机器学习，是一类方法，可以从原始输入中得到一种映射，比如从单个像素的灰度，到特定的输出，如一种疾病的分类。采用机器学习的话，输入是基于手工工程的特征，而无监督的深度学习可以从数据中直接学习这些特征。多个研究团体都在研究应用AI，以改进CT图像的重建。一种应用是，基于图像空间的重建，CNN的训练，输入是低剂量CT，而重建得到的常规剂量的CT图像。另一种方法是优化IR算法。一般来说，IR算法是基于手工设计的先验函数的，得到的低噪声图像不会损失结构。深度学习方法可以使用更复杂的函数，使更低剂量的CT和稀疏采样CT得到可能。这些AI技术可以降低CT剂量，同时加速重建时间。同时，深度学习可以用于优化图像质量，而不降低辐射剂量，如，通过更先进的DECT单色图像重建和降低金属伪影。这些方法尚未可以进行临床实现；但是，AI在图像重建和图像恢复中起到很主要的作用，是可以期待的。我们希望，AI会融入到目前的临床CT成像流程中，增强目前的重建方法，比如可以显著加速重建过程，因为训练好的网络的使用是立刻的。

In conclusion, IR is a powerful technique that has arrived in clinical practice, and even more exciting advances can be expected from IR in the near future.

结论是，IR是一种很强的技术，已经达到的临床实用的阶段，IR在未来可以有更令人激动的进展。
