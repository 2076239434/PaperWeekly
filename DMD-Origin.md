# The pioneering work that led to the DMD 带来DMD的先驱性工作

Michael Mignardi Oct 6, 2016 Texas Instruments

I started working at Texas Instruments in the late-1980s, a time after Dr. Larry Hornbeck invented the digital micromirror device (DMD) in 1987. The overall development of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) upon which DLP® chips are based was still in its infancy.

我从1980s后期开始在TI工作，这是在Dr. Larry Hornbeck 1987年发明了数字微镜设备(DMD)不久。DLP芯片的基础，即微机电系统(MEMS)，其发展仍然在襁褓状态。

With MEMS as a framework, the broad array of DLP technology applications that we see today – everything from advanced light control, to portable projection displays and automotive solutions – had not yet even been considered.

有了MEMS这样一个框架，DLP技术应用的广泛案例，从高级光线控制，到可移动投影展示，和汽车解决方案，尚未得到被考虑到。

## The origins of the DMD DMD的起源

I joined the photonics division, what would later become the DLP Products business, at TI with a Ph.D. in chemistry.

我和一位化学博士加入了TI的光电子部门，后来变成了DLP产品。

We were tasked with developing a MEMS device that could steer photons. It was this endeavor, based on the tireless research and development of multiple, distinct scientific and engineering disciplines, that ultimately led to the development of the first DMD in 1987.  For example, one major challenge we had at that time was developing the process chemistry to cleanly remove the sacrificial layer without impacting the micromirror in the process.

我们的任务是，开发一套MEMS设备，要可以操控光子。正是这项工作，基于无数的研究和多种不同的科学和工程原则的开发，最终带来了1987年第一台DMD设备。比如，我们那个时候的一个主要挑战是，研究在采用化学过程，干净的去除sacrificial层这个过程时，不要影响到微镜结构。

The micromirror design we worked on at that time was very simple.  It consisted of 840 micromirrors and two hinges that connected to the micromirror itself. The micromirror had 4 access holes to allow for sacrificial layer removal.  To say the least, this micromirror was not as optically efficient as the DMDs we use today.

我们那个时候工作的微镜设计是非常简单的，是由840个微镜和两个铰链组成的，铰链连接到微镜。微镜有4个孔可以进行sacrificial层的去除。至少可以说，这个微镜不如我们今天使用的DMDs这样光学效率高。

That was when we realized the DMD – a layered MEMS chip gleaming with thousands of light-bending microscopic mirrors – could change how the world interacts with video projection and displays. Thus, if we could productize a device with 840 micromirrors, we could certainly productize a device with millions of micromirrors.

这就是DMD，一种分层的MEMS芯片，闪烁着数千个可以反射光的微小镜片，我们这时意识到，着可以改变世界通过视频投射和显示进行交互的方式。所以，如果我们能够将840个微镜做成产品，我们当然也可以把包含数百万个微镜的设备产品化。

## The role of MEMS today

Fast forward three decades. Today our DLP chips are used in an ever-expanding variety of applications, from movie theaters to hand-held spectrometers and even in automotive head-up displays (HUD). Our chips can handle a broad spectrum of electromagnetic wavelengths, from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) light.  Although the MEMS design has evolved over the years, the robustness of the core architecture continues to be an effective solution that allows engineers the flexibility to steer photons and display light.

快进30年。今天我们的DLP芯片正用于不断扩张的众多应用中，从电影院，到手持分光仪，甚至在汽车平视显示中(HUD)。我们的芯片可以处理很宽频谱的电磁波长，从紫外(UV)光到近红外(NIR)光。虽然MEMS设计已经发展了数年，核心架构的稳健性一直是一个有效的解决方案，使得工程师有操控光子和显示光的灵活性。

I believe the reason for the DMD’s success echoes a larger shift in electronics, from macro-scale mechanical elements like switches and relays, to solid-state devices. What’s happening today, however, is the realization that certain functions are still best performed by mechanical devices.

我相信，DMD成功的原因是电子学众多要素合作的原因，从宏观尺度的力学要素，如开关和继电器，到固态设备。但是，今天发生的，是因为一些功能最好由机械设备完成。

Consider this: While solid-state solutions struggle to detect environmental inputs like motion, pressure, sound and chemical sensing, MEMS solutions, like a DMD, really shines. That’s because MEMS combine the best of macromechanical solutions and solid-state technology in a smaller, lower cost and high performance form factor.  A non-DMD example would be the integration of a MEMS device, such as a Silicon MEMS microphone and its associated electronics, which provide a robust and reliable solution for consumer electronics compared to its macro-counterpart.

考虑这个：固态解决方案在检测环境输入时有困难，如运动，压力，声音和化学感应，MEMS的解决方案，如DMD，确实要更加优秀。这是因为MEMS将最好的微力学解决方案和固态技术结合到了一个更小的，更低功耗，更高性能的要素中。非DMD的例子，是将MEMS设备及相关的电子设备整合到一起，如一个硅MEMS麦克风，和消费电子的稳健可靠解决方案，这是有宏观层面的对应部分的。

## What’s next for MEMS?

When I first began working on DLP technology, our biggest challenge was delivering hundreds of thousands of tiny mirrors that operated collectively to enable digital projection.

当我第一次研究DLP技术时，我们最大的挑战是，交付成百上千个微小的镜子，集体工作才能进行数字投射。

Today, I don’t think there is much arguing with our reliability. Many of our original DMDs have been running continuously for more than two decades.

今天，我觉得我们的可靠性已经没有什么疑问了。我们的很多原始DMD已经连续运行了超过两个世纪了。

We’re now focused on delivering DLP chips with a variety of performance characteristics, such as faster switching speeds, to enable diverse end equipment.

我们现在聚焦于交付不同性能特性的多种DLP芯片，比如更快切换速度的，以使得多种终端设备成为可能。

The co-location of our design, product and process teams allows for fast development cycles as we continue to improve our products.

我们的设计、生产和处理团队的协同工作，使得开发循环的速度更快，我们也在不断的改进我们的产品。

MEMS technology, like our DLP technology, is poised to find more uses than ever before. From intelligent smart home displays to next-generation augmented reality, the work from TI, our partners and customers are already a shining example of innovation.

MEMS技术，就像我们的DLP技术一样，也在不断寻找更多的应用。从智慧家庭显示到下一代增强现实，TI、我们的合作伙伴和客户的工作，已经是创新的闪亮例子。
